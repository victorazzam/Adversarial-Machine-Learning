The dataset for the first defensive notebook is given in `notebooks/defensive/1/dataset.txt` as a link.

The last section titled Debugging concerns missing package issues. (Not all notebooks are meant to run by default, due to package incompatibility. If you wish to install them manually, run `!pip install package_name` in any notebook inside the container via the Jupyter Notebook web interface.)
